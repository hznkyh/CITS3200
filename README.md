# Running the application 

## Using Docker

This web-application has been configured to use a docker container, so can be launched 
simply using that. If you do not have docker, download it from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). 
Ensure you are working from the main directory, then use the following 
command to activate the web-app using docker: 

>  `docker-compose up -d --build`

The application should then launch on localhost:8080.
