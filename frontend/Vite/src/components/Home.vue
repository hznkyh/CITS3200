    <p>Welcome to the Moving Target Defence Simulator page!</p>
    <p>Moving target defence is a technique to thwart cyber attacks by continuously changing the attack surface. 
      It largely categorise into three: shuffle, diversity, and redundancy, and those techniques can be implemented in any layers of the system (e.g., think of OSI layers). 
      To simulate this, we need to model three key components: the system, the attacker, and the MTD techniques. 
      This project aims to implement these components by writing new modules and refactoring existing modules for improved user experience.</p>
